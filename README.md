# Rpg-Awesome-Viewer

This is a quick viewer for the RPG Awesome, created by using the library of SVG icons from [Game Icons](https://game-icons.net/). It was created by [Daniela Howe](https://github.com/nagoshiashumari) and [Ivan Montiel](http://github.com/idmontie) ([source code](https://github.com/nagoshiashumari/Rpg-Awesome)), but I am using te most updated fork, that can be found here: [RPG Awesome](https://github.com/OpenDominion/Rpg-Awesome).


In this viewer you can see the different icons, enable / disable a black outline, change the colors, and copy them to the click board. [Click here to access the RPG Awesome Viewer.](https://rafaeligdev.github.io/Rpg-Awesome-Viewer/)
